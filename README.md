# Data Structure Practice
There are my practice works regrading to **Data Structure** course.<br>
All projects use Java Language.
<br><br>
1.[Dynamic Array](https://github.com/yyywrz/DataStructurePractice/blob/master/DynamicArray/DynamicArray.java)<br>
It functions as following:<br>
* The initial capcity is 1
* It expends the capcity doubly when size is not enough
* It shrinks the capcity into half when 2/3 of array are empty
* It can be achieved by neither array or linked list. I used array in this case.
