# Data Structure Practice
There are my noyes and practice works regrading to **Data Structure** course.<br>
All projects use Java Language.
<br><br>
1. [Dynamic Array](https://github.com/yyywrz/DataStructurePractice/blob/master/DynamicArray/DynamicArray.java)<br>
It functions as following:<br>
* The initial capcity is 1
* It expends the capcity doubly when size is not enough
* It shrinks the capcity into half when 2/3 of array are empty
* It can be achieved by neither array or linked list.<br>
<br><br>
2. Simulator of Stack and Queue
* [Stack](https://github.com/yyywrz/DataStructurePractice/blob/master/stack/StackSimulator.java)
   * Stack is a first-in-last-out data structure
   * Two pricipal operations of a stack are 
      * push()
      * pop() 
* [Queue](https://github.com/yyywrz/DataStructurePractice/blob/master/Queue/QueueSimulator.java)
   * Queue is a first-in-first-out data structure
   * Two pricipal opration of a queue are
      * Enqueue()
      * Dequeue()
      <br><br>
3. Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree
   * [Binary Search Tree by Linked list](https://github.com/yyywrz/DataStructurePractice/blob/master/BStreeByLinkedlist/BStree.java)
