# Data Structure Practice
There are my notes and practice works regrading to **Data Structure** course.<br>
All projects use Java Language.
<br><br>
1. [Dynamic Array](https://github.com/yyywrz/DataStructurePractice/blob/master/DynamicArray/DynamicArray.java)<br>
It functions as following:<br>
* The initial capcity is 1
* It expends the capcity doubly when size is not enough
* It shrinks the capcity into half when 2/3 of array are empty
* It can be achieved by neither array or linked list.<br>
<br><br>
2. Simulator of Stack and Queue
* [Stack](https://github.com/yyywrz/DataStructurePractice/blob/master/stack/StackSimulator.java)
   * Stack is a first-in-last-out data structure
   * Two pricipal operations of a stack are 
      * push()
      * pop() 
* [Queue](https://github.com/yyywrz/DataStructurePractice/blob/master/Queue/QueueSimulator.java)
   * Queue is a first-in-first-out data structure
   * Two pricipal opration of a queue are
      * Enqueue()
      * Dequeue()
      <br><br>
3. Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree
   * [Binary Search Tree by Linked list](https://github.com/yyywrz/DataStructurePractice/blob/master/BStreeByLinkedlist/BStree.java)
   <br>This is a sample of sorting by binary tree.<br>
   * [Binary Search Tree Contact Book](https://github.com/yyywrz/DataStructurePractice/blob/master/BStreeByLinkedlist/Table.java)
      * This project is achieved by BST
      * It stores person's names and addresses, and contacts are sorted by alphabetical order of their names
      * It support following operation: 1. insertion and deletion 2.searching(check if contact exist) 3.updating(replace previous address by new one)<br><br>
* [Self-balancing Binary Search Tree(AVL tree)](https://github.com/yyywrz/DataStructurePractice/blob/master/BStreeByLinkedlist/AVLTable.java)
<br> It functions as same as BST contact book. The only difference is it is achieved by AVL tree.
